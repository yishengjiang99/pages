## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm
- **FFmpeg installed on the system** (for server-side processing)
- xAI API token (get one from https://console.x.ai/)
- (Optional) Stripe API keys for payment processing

### FFmpeg Installation

#### Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
```

#### macOS:
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

#### Windows:
Download from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add to PATH.

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Configuration

1. Copy the example environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Edit `.env` and add your xAI API token:
```bash
XAI_API_TOKEN=your_actual_token_here
```

3. (Optional) Add Stripe API keys for payment processing:
```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key_here
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here
```

See [docs/STRIPE.md](./docs/STRIPE.md) for detailed Stripe integration documentation.

**Important**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It's already included in `.gitignore`.

### Development Server

You need to run both the proxy server and the Vite dev server:

**Terminal 1 - Start the proxy server:**
```bash
npm run server
```

**Terminal 2 - Start the Vite dev server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

The proxy server runs on `http://localhost:3001` and handles xAI API calls securely.

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory.

### Testing

```bash
npm test
```

Run tests with Vitest.

## Usage

1. Start the server (which serves both the API proxy and handles video processing)
2. Upload a video file or use the "Try with Sample Video" button
3. Describe the edits you want in natural language
4. The AI will apply the appropriate filters and transformations using server-side FFmpeg
5. A spinner will display while ffmpeg is processing your video

### Sample Video

The application includes a "Try with Sample Video" feature on the landing page. To use this feature, you need to place a file named `BigBuckBunny.mp4` in the `finalcut/public/` directory.

You can download Big Buck Bunny (a free sample video) from:
```bash
cd finalcut/public
curl -o BigBuckBunny.mp4 "http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4"
```

Alternatively, you can use any MP4 video file and name it `BigBuckBunny.mp4`.

## Architecture

FinalCut now uses **server-side FFmpeg processing** for improved reliability and performance:

- **Client (React)**: Handles UI, chat interface, and file uploads
- **Server (Node.js + Express)**: 
  - Proxies requests to xAI API (keeping API token secure)
  - Processes videos using native FFmpeg via fluent-ffmpeg library
  - Returns processed videos to the client

### Benefits of Server-Side Processing

- ✅ **More Reliable**: Uses native FFmpeg instead of WebAssembly
- ✅ **Better Performance**: Native code is faster than WASM
- ✅ **No Browser Limitations**: No memory constraints or CORS issues
- ✅ **Works Everywhere**: Compatible with all browsers without special headers
- ✅ **Easier Debugging**: Server-side logs make troubleshooting simpler

## Security

The xAI API token is securely stored on the server side and never exposed to the client. The token is read from the `.env` file and used by the Node.js server to authenticate requests to the xAI API.

Video files are processed on the server and immediately cleaned up after processing, ensuring no data persists on the server.

## Technology Stack

- **React 18** - UI framework
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **Node.js + Express** - Server and API
- **FFmpeg (native)** - Server-side video processing via fluent-ffmpeg
- **Multer** - File upload handling
- **xAI Grok API** - AI-powered editing assistance
- **Vitest** - Testing framework
- **React Testing Library** - Component testing
